## Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style:

- **ESLint**: For code linting and catching potential errors
- **Prettier**: For code formatting

Run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Fix linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

Format code:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Testing

We use Jest for testing. Run tests with:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
npm run check
```

### Building

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:

3. Run tests and linting:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
